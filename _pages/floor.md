## Game Summary 
Game board is a 2D grid of squares, each with a specific category. Each square is occupied by one contestant. The first challenger is selected randomly. Challenger picks an adjacent opponent to duel using opponent's category. Winner takes over the opponent's square; the loser is eliminated. The winner can choose to attack again (from adjacent opponents) or pass control back to the system to pick a new challenger. Game ends when one contestant controls all squares.
