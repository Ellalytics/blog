## Core Modules

### ðŸ‘¤  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **User & Role Management:** Developed a flexible framework to manage user roles (Administrator, Operator, Technician, Auditor) with **granular permissions**, covering module, action, and field-level controls.
- **Permission Control:** Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce secure and restricted access to **modules, data, and operations**.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed a decoupled system where permissions, roles, and users are independent, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

###  Resource Management
- **Equipment Management:** Optimized **site equipment management** by enhancing **maintenance records**, **procurement plans**, and **status tracking**, ensuring seamless operations and data accuracy.
- **Document Management:** Built **secure**, **efficient document management** features for uploading, downloading, and searching technical files, boosting accessibility and data integrity.

### Site Operations
- **Site Info & Monitoring:** Monitored site performance, including fault types, duration, resolutions, and trend analysis with **role-filtered dashboards**.  
- **Maintenance:** Scheduled and tracked maintenance tasks, recorded faults, and implemented resolutions to ensure system reliability.
