In infrastructure projects, cost control isn’t just about crunching numbers — it’s about making informed decisions, and starts with access to the right documents: **price references**, **legal texts**, **technical standards**, and **regulatory guidelines**.

I was part of an ambitious digital transformation effort with Power Grid. The goal is **Making Complex Information Instantly Searchable**. In traditional engineering and cost management workflows, locating the correct clause in a regulation, the latest price index, or a relevant national standard can take significant time and manual effort. We designed and implemented a feature that brings all this under one intelligent interface.

##  Key Features
- **Semantic search support** for natural-language queries(->RAG)
- Full-text indexing of documents like **price catalogs**, **legal texts**, and **engineering codes**
- Filter-by-category and metadata tagging 
- Integration with the platform’s cost analysis and review modules
- Instant linking between search results and business tasks 

### Impact
The search engine's become a key tool — it’s cut down lookup time by over 70% and made cost decisions faster and more reliable throughout the whole project. It demonstrates how intelligent, targeted features, integrated into specialized platforms, can add substantial value. I’m proud to have played a key role in this transformation and look forward to continuing to explore how AI and smart search can drive better decisions in engineering and infrastructure.

### More about
My work contributed to the development of a comprehensive digital cost management platform, which will fully transform power grid construction by its launch in March 2025.<br>

_News source: www.bjx.com.cn_<br><br>
“The institute has been driving the comprehensive enhancement of "professional improvement, standardized construction, and digital intelligence support" in cost management. Focusing on the "Six Precision and Four Specializations" requirements for infrastructure construction by State Grid Corporation of China, the platform construction was officially started in 2020. The project was carried out in two phases and took five years to complete.

The platform integrates big data analysis for cost control, technical and economic management, information release, and talent exchange for Power Grid’s construction projects. It achieves dynamic monitoring, analysis, and early warning of construction cost data, supporting the company in realizing the full digital management of the entire power grid construction process — from estimation to settlement. This ensures precise, efficient, and scientifically rational investment in power grid projects with top-tier digital intelligence methods.”<br>
